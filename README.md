**Planning and research**
Me and Tania decided early on that we wanted a similar style of webpage, we decided this as it would be the best way to help each other as our code and layout would be similar and we would overcome the same problems.
We decided on a layout from a biography online and both chose a color palette on Colorhunt.com that we wanted and shared them with each other to work from.
When it came to deciding what we wanted to have on our page we started with the idea of going with a fabricated profile to keep it fun but when we saw the results from a survey a fellow bootcamper sent out we decided to go with normal profiles and came up with a interview, answer style format we thought that people would want to know about us and we want to know about them so to put accurate information was the best idea.

**Creating the page**
I started with adding a navigaton bar and title - this later became an issue as i orginally added the code as a list function it worked until i had to add another list for the social media links icons. I later changed this to just links with knowledge that was shared in one of our group meetings to just use the links, I then adjusted the CSS to have the correct colors and hover functions. I added in Tanias image and social media links which are fully functioning. The navbar just has # place holder links and is there for aesthetics purposes only. 

I then began using flexbox in a coding session with Tania to create columns and space everything out evenly on my page. I wanted the page to have a clean and light feel to it, so with the content I used the <p> tag to seperate all of my text for ease,simplicity and aesthitic purposes. 
  
 I had a footer at the beginning of starting the project which seemed to work fine, when i added flexbox it was going in different places each team i adjusted the css and I struggled to get it to stay in the centre at the bottom- due to time restriction as this was at the end of week 2 i decided to keep the footer in the corner at the bottom in a very pale grey color. 
 
 I then played around with colors using the color palette Tania chose and other colors that went well with them.











# Website Challenge

## Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

The person you are making your website for is your partner, aka The Client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what the client wants from a profile site, assess what information is available and useful, design what serves the audience of users (aka the other bootcampers) best from the experience, and then create something which best solves those needs. You won't be given any guidance of what to build - you'll need to empathise with your users to see what they would find useful (or even survey and talk to them), and plan your site accordingly.

## Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS
- a profile describing your client
- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

## Extra

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core skills of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website for a client, and have a user-centric approach - a key learning objective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with the client to find out everything you need in order to design and build a website which represents them to the rest of the cohort.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, there is nothing stopping you pair programming with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the bootcamp, and you will be given time in live evening sessions to work on it as well.
